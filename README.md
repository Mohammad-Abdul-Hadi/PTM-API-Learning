### Fine-Tuning the Models
If you want to finetune the models, please redirect to *Fine Tune on models* directory, which contains 6 separate model directories that come with separate README.md files.

### Testing the Fine-Tuned Models
Otherwise, just to test the resulting models on the test data, please redirect to *Test Models on Test data v \*.0* directory. Each of these directories contains 5 separate model directories that come with separate README.md files.

- *Test Models on Test data v 0.0* refer to the models that were trained without any custom tokenization approach.
- *Test Models on Test data v 1.0* refer to the models that were trained with tokenization approach - 1.
- *Test Models on Test data v 2.0* refer to the models that were trained withwith tokenization approach - 2.
